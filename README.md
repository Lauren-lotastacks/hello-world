My Experimental Place


So it's been about three months since I started my coding journey. Really the first part of this comment: 'My Experimental Place' was done around this time too. Ive learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I still feel like a majority of the things I know are basic but, I am optimistic for the future.
